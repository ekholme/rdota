`rdota` provides an interface to query the [OpenDota API](https://docs.opendota.com/) using R and return the data in a tidy format.


## Constants

In addition to providing functions to query the OpenDota API, `rdota` also directly provides some game data that is relatively constant over time. These built-in datasets provide data on heroes, items, and abilities. They can be found in the following files:

- `heroes`,
- `items`,
- `abilities`,
- `ability_ids`, and
- `item_ids`


## Installation

You can install `rdota` using:

```{r install-msg, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("ekholme/rdota")
```
